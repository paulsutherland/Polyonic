                <p>Well, duh. USA's Mr. Robot is probably the most accurate and detailed dramatic portrayal ever made of current hacking practices and hacker culture. Its depiction of the cybersecurity community and its broader meditation on the relationship between humans and technology isn't perfect. (Not to mention that Season 2, which aired this year, had some narrative issues.) But overall the show is compelling and full of delightful references and winks to the cybersecurity subculture.</p>

                <p>The story of whistleblower Edward Snowden is the most dramatic spy story of the decade. An Oliver Stone biopic was inevitable. So here it is. As movies almost always do, Snowden eliminates the nuance from this complicated and controversial story, painting Snowden as a hero and the National Security Agency as a one-dimensional villain. But as WIRED pointed out when the movie debuted, Snowden is important because it's the accessible version of events that many Americans will remember.</p>

                <p>It's not every day that a network drama puts the ethics and repercussions of bulk surveillance at the core of its premise, but CBS's Person of Interest managed to do it successfully. The show combines government surveillance to stop terrorist attacks with an eccentric hacker billionaire and vigilante justice. It even grapples with questions of how an artificial intelligence evolves and incorporates biases. Person of Interest is particularly known for airing a prescient episode in 2012 about a National Security Agency whistleblower very similar to Edward Snowden.</p>

We strive to embrace and drive change in our industry which allows us to keep our clients relevant and ready to adapt. As creatives, it's important that we strive to do work outside of obligation. This lets us stay ahead of the curve for our clients and internal projects. At the end of the day, it's important to not let being busy distract us from having fun. Smiling, laughing, and hanging helps us work together to achieve this.</p>
